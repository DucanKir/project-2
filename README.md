## Wins and Blockers:
The most difficult thing was to make filters work with each other. For example, if the user wants to filter games by price AND categories at the same time.


We had two days for this project and there a lot of things we could add but had no time, that is why we focused on main functionality of the website. During this project I learned more about JavaScript and React, practiced working with API and working in team.
In future I would like to add some features to this website. For example I would like to add users and user profile, so that users could add games to wishlist. Also It would be great to add comments to games.
