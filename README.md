We had two days for this project and there a lot of things we could add but had no time, that is why we focused on main functionality of the website. During this project I learned more about JavaScript and React, practiced working with API and working in team.
In future I would like to add some features to this website. For example I would like to add users and user profile, so that users could add games to wishlist. Also It would be great to add comments to games.
